# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

I also found that playing Space Chem was fun

## Week 1 (24/9/18 to 30/9/18)  
The week itself was a lot fun building lego robots and programing the robots using MindStorms visual scripting platform. Althought i found it hard to meet a lot of new people especially while being in a new place and having to work in teams. It caused me to get a little streesed when tring to commecate within the team and led to me felling a bit out of my depth.

I should do some research on networking and attend events to help with meeting new people and it should get easier the more events i attend.

## Week 2  (1/10/18 to 7/10/18)
I have found it hard to get git setup correctly and learning some of the basic commands of git-bash and to learn how to use tortious git as it’s got more fetchers than I’m used to using in Git Desktop for personal projects.  
After the difficulties with git I watched the videos on learning space and googled stuffing I didn’t understand or wanted to find more out about. As I was doing git research, I created a cheat sheet as I went so I have quick lookup of git-bash command that I am not that familiar with yet.  
I need to keep this keep this up, so I can get more familiar with git and learn more advanced fetchers and I feel I should use git-scm.org more so I can get a more in depth knowledge of commands I already know the basics of.
Also, I am really starting to feel well out of my depth and I’m wondering if university is the right path for me. I feel there is not much I can do about right now and I should see how I feel at the end of the first semester, in the mean time I could talk to a tutor about it and discuss my goals to get a clearer vision of where university can lead me along that path.  


## Week 3 (8/10/18 to 14/10/18)
I have found it hard to stand up in front of the class and pitch my game idea. This is something I fell will only get better over time the more I do it. It doesn’t help that I’m still finding it difficult to get to know people, but this is getting better as I’m starting to get settled in although still a bit out of my depth.  
My game pitch didn’t go to badly as my game was chosen but I could of been more prepared. I should of rehearsed my pitch, which I did not do at all and put more planning into the flow of my talk although I did create a slid deck which helped, I could of done more.  
Following the game pitch, we formed into our teams and discussed the game idea so we had a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve which all went pretty well.  
The first commit to our git was made by another team member which was not structed well, so I cleaned it up a bit and established a structure using functions and classed so I could implement the input system for the game, I also encouraged commenting the best I could.  
I also started work on the player animation, by creating an animation class that takes a sprite sheet then extracts the required sprite depending on the time position of the animation which is then blited to the display surface.  
Its been fairly pleasant and exciting working on our game, but I have been spending to much time drawing sprites for the game so others can do work with out me bottlenecking the rest of the team which has had a bit of a negative effect on me when I just want to code. This should be resolved next semester when we are in multidiscipline teams, I also need to realize I no longer need to create my own assets and for projects like this I should use free assets from the internet.  

## Week 4 (15/10 to 21/10/18)
I mostly supported my team during the week by mostly navigating, while another team member was the driver while we where working on some UI elements, this was mostly focused on UI buttons.  
Over the weekend I started work on a tile editor, so that the designers and end-users can create assets easily. It is able to load all .png file for any directory within the game, reskin them and save to a new .png file. I’ve done this as maintainable as i can but feel that areas could be more improved, as its difficult to understand some of the list, even with excessive commenting. I should seek advice from a tutor to see if there is a better approach, i could also do further research online in places like python.org to see if I can find something that is better suited to the problem.  

## Week 5 (22/10/18 to 28/10/18)
I finished the tile editor as part of my Comp-120 work and included it into our game after our retrospective i relize that it was a bit featcher creep as far as the game whent but overall i got good feedback.
I missed guese lecture on networking, looking back at week 1 that was a bad descision, i feel that i needed to catch up with some work and i dient achive as much as i would of like to due to interuptions from my team. Affter hearing from my peers this guess lecture would of beifited me and i'v directly learn from this lake of jugment.

I found that it was hard to come up with a research question and do the proposal and i have an unfinished proposal and as a result im extreamly nervice about the agile essay as i've never write an essay befor. I should seek as much advice from my tutors as i can about essay writing and how tecniques for doing academic research.
